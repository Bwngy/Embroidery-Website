        <p>Welcome to my embroidery webpage, where you will learn about the right materials to use, an effective process to get started, and discover inspiration. I hope all this information is of great use to you all and helps you get started on your embroidery journey!</p>
        <p>My name is Bryan Wang, and I enjoy line art/manga embroidery. I started embroidering during quarantine and watching too much anime and not having a hobby I enjoyed fully. After coming across an Instagram page of the most amazing manga embroidery, I fell in love and immediately wanted to get started. However, there was not much valuable information online on how to get started, so after weeks and weeks of trial and error and buying different products, I finally feel like I have found a good process for creating embroidery art.

        <p id="disclaimer">You may find other products work well for you and that is great! I just hope I can offer some insight to beginners who do not know where to start and want to save money ;)</p>
