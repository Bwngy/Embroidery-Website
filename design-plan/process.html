        <h2>Drafting a Design</h2>
        <p>To begin, find an image that you want to create. This can be found on Pinterest, Google Images, or wherever you find creative inspiration. Alternatively, if you're feeling extra creative, sketch something out.</p>
        <p>Next, you'll want to push the image (or sketch) into some drawing software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fresco. To create the "skeleton" as I like to call it, trace over the entire image, making sure to clearly map out the parts that you want to embroider. Add thicker lines to areas that you want to emphasize, such as the border of the image. Add thinner lines for finer details, such as shading lines and small letters.</p>

        <h2>Transferring the Design</h2>
        <p>Now how do we get this design onto the fabric? The simplest and most precise way is to simply print it! To do so:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a piece of 8.5x11 sticker paper and stick it to the fabric.</li>
            <li>Cut along the edges of the sticker paper, being sure to cut all loose strands off while avoiding the edges of the paper</li>

            </figure>
            <li>Depending on your printer, place the entire sheet into the printer, and print as usual. Be sure it is black and white to prevent color bleeding.</li>

            </figure>
            <li>Print, let dry for a few minutes, and peel off the sticker paper. <em>Voila!</em> you have your design on your fabric ready to use.</li>

        <h2>Preparing Your Hoop</h2>
        <p>To prepare the hoop, insert your fabric so that there is some hanging around the edge. placing the hoop fabric side down, tug on the corners of the hoop as you tighten the screw on the top of the hoop. Once the screw cannot be tightened any more, the fabric should be taut enough to start working! </p>
        <p>Drum Trick: a good trick to see if it is tight enough is to tap on the fabric. If it beats like a drum, you are good to go!</p>

        <h2>Stitching</h2>
        <p>Now that the preparation is finished, it is time to start working! To be honest, stitching is something best learned through experience. Embroidery is super hands on! However, I can offer some tips and tricks to help things go a bit more smoothly.</p>
        <p>For line art, there are two primary stitches that are used: running stitches and back stitches. Though this may sound scary, they are pretty simple once you get the hang of it. Here are some example pictures of how it is done:</p>
        <p>Get your needle and thread out, and try it out.</p>
        <p>To embroider, fill in the lines that you drew during the drafting stage until everything is all filled. For thin lines, you should only go over the line once. For thicker lines, try going over the lines twice or thrice to create dimension and bring your project to life! Though some may refer to this as thread painting, I refer to it as thread sketching. It really is like using a pencil to draw, except you are using thread.</p>
        <p>Remember, patience is key. No one gets it the first time. Even I am still learning! Enjoy the process :)</p>

        <h2>Final Touches</h2>
        <p>To ensure that there are no missing parts that may have been forgotten, I like to use my phone's flashlight to shine beneath the project to reveal any areas that have not been completed.</p>
        <p>When you feel satisfied with how the project works, it is time to finish the hoop. To do so...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Flip over the hoop</li>
            <li>Perform a long running stitch around the circumference of the hoop, grabbing all the excess fabric</li>
            <li>Finally, pull the thread and the outside fabric will magically come to the center and enclose the back of the hoop. It is now ready to be given as a gift, hung in your room, or sold on Etsy!</li>
