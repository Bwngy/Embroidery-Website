Header: Bryan's Embroidery Page

Header 2: Welcome to my embroidery webpage, where you will learn about the right materials to use, an effective process to get started, and discover inspiration. I hope all this information is of great use to you all and helps you get started on your embroidery journey!

Intro: My name is Bryan Wang, and I enjoy line art/manga embroidery. I started embroidering during quarantine and watching too much anime and not having a hobby I enjoyed fully. After coming across an Instagram page of the most amazing manga embroidery, I fell in love and immediately wanted to get started. However, there was not much valuable information online on how to get started, so after weeks and weeks of trial and error and buying different products, I finally feel like I have found a good process for creating embroidery art.

Disclaimer: this is what works for me. You may find other products work well for you and that is great! I just hope I can offer some insight to beginners who do not know where to start and want to save money ;)

# Getting started

So how do I get from *this* to **this**? On this page, I will show you step by step how to prepare, execute, and finish an embroidered piece.

Drafting a design:
- Go on pinterest, instagram, google, etc
- find an image you like
- push the image into adobe photoshop, fresco, or other drawing app
  - if working on an iPad, turn the touchscreen off
- after tracing, prepare the fabrisolvy/fabric for printing
- put the sticker paper on a sheet of fabric and cut it out
- place it face down in the printer, and print the design onto the fabric
- let it dry for a couple minutes, and then peel off the sticker paper and prepare the hoop!
HOOP:
- Here's something I learned the hard way: If you buy a good hoop, it will do most of the work for you. I intially used these wooden hoops, which are very pretty but are horrible for tension. If you want a good hoop, I recommend one made out of hard plastc. These are less pliable and allow for good, long-lasting tension which is critical for am embroidered piece. Without tension, the piece will be difficult to work with, and a lot of precision will be lost. It also may lead to the project slipping out mid-project, which is both scary and frustrating. Invest in a good hoop and save yourself some stress!
- To prepare the hoop, insert your fabric so that there is some hanging around the edge. placing the hoop fabric side down, tug on the corners of the hoop as you tighten the screw on the top of the hoop. Once the screw cannot be tightened any more, the fabric should be taught enough to start working!
- Drum Trick: a good trick to see if it is tight enough is to tap on the fabric. If it beats like a drum, you are good to go!
STITCHING:
- Now that the preparation is finished, it is time to start working! To be honest, stitching is something best learned through experience. Embroidery is super hands one! However, I can offer some tips and tricks to help things go a bit more smoothly.
- For the needle, thread the floss into the eye. Allow the ends to meet, and then tie a knot at the end.
- For line art, there are two primary stitches that are used: running stitches and back stitches. Though this may sound scary, they are pretty simple once you get the hang of it. Here are some example pictures of how it is done:
  - Get your needle and thread out, and try it out.
- To embroidery, basically fill in the lines that you drew during the drafting stage until everything is all filled. For thin lines, you should only go over the line once. For thicker lines, try going over the lines twice or thrice to create dimension and bring your project to life! Though some may refer to this as thread painting, I refer to it as thread sketching. It really is like using a pencil to draw, except you are using thread.
FINAL TOUCHES:
- To ensure that there are no missing parts that may have been forgotten, I like to use my phone's flashlight to shine beneath the project to reveal any areas that have not been completed.
- When you feel satisfied with how the project works, it is time to finish the hoop. To do so...
- Flip over the hoop
- Perform a long running stitch around the circumference of the hoop, grabbing all the excess fabric.
- Finally, pull the thread and the outside fabric will magically come to the center and enclose the back of the hoop. It is now ready to be given as a gift, hung in your room, or sold on Etsy!
